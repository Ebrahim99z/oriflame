# oriflame
hey ,this is my first real prject with j-s.
my site is full responsive at 6 sizes.
and i try to be close to main oriflame.
after this site i got why realy programmres use frameworks like "React" to creating elemnts in j-S :)
My site data is in db.json so you need to run my json then you can see the site properly (cmd code: "npm run json").
I took a video of my site so you can see how it works.
